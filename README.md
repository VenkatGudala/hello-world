Just another respository

Hello!

This is Venkat Gudala from Houston TX, USA and this is my first commit message in the GitHub. I have set myself a newgoal to become a Data Scientist after stumbled across an article about www.palantir.com. After reading how palantir helps law enforcement agencies tackle child trafficking, slavery, human trafficking, drug peddling & terrorist activies, I felt inspired and awed to know how the guys sit infront of computers are making the world a better place to live in their own way. Even if it's a drop of effort to the ocean of problems and if that effort helps fellow humans live with diginity and no fear, that's alot for me as an individual. I feel in this data intensive world, ability to process, analyze and generate useful insights from the data is a power that could be used for betterment of the world. I have the ability and will to learn the skills of this "Data Science" for living and for betterment of the world. Apart from builing a career as a Data Scientist, I would like to keep aquiring the new skills needed to analyze the data more efficiently and put them to good use by helping non-profits, that deal with poverty, Social Justice, Human Rights, Sustainability, Pollution, Poverty Alleviation & Peace, around the world.

Thanks,
Venkat G
